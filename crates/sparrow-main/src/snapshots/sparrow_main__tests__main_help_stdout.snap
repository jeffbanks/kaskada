Options:
      --log-filters <LOG_FILTERS>
          Log & tracing filter configuration.
          
          Defaults to `egg::=warn,sparrow_=trace,info` which omits most traces from the `egg` crate (because it's very log-heavy), and `trace` from any of the sparrow crates (`sparrow_runtime`, `sparrow_main`, etc.), and `info` from other crates.
          
          [env: SPARROW_LOG_FILTER=]
          [default: egg::=warn,sparrow_=trace,info]

      --tracing-enabled
          Whether OpenTelemetry tracing should be enabled
          
          [env: SPARROW_OTEL_TRACING_ENABLED=]

      --log-json
          Whether logs should be exported as JSON.
          
          When JSON logs are enabled we include the Trace ID in log messages and omit parent spans information.
          
          [env: SPARROW_LOG_JSON=]

      --log-no-color <LOG_NO_COLOR>
          Whether to disable color output in logs.
          
          Set to `1` to disable color output.
          
          [env: NO_COLOR=]
          [default: 0]

      --disable-log-panic-handler
          Enables a custom panic handler which logs panics.
          
          This may be disabled to get the default backtrace and re-entrant panic handler.
          
          [env: SPARROW_DISABLE_LOG_PANIC_HANDLER=]
