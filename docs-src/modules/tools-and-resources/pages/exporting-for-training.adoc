= Example Modeling Problem

We'll begin by laying out a simple modeling problem, based on the
xref:fenl:fenl-quick-start.adoc[Fenl Quickstart] guide. The goal will be to build a
model predicting if a given purchase will result in a fraud report
within the next 30 days given two event tables; a `Purchase` table and a
`FraudReport` table.

== Setup

[source,python]
----
from kaskada import table
import pandas
import requests

table.create_table(
  table_name = "Purchase",
  time_column_name = "purchase_time",
  entity_key_column_name = "id",
  subsort_column_name = "subsort_id",
)
table.create_table(
  table_name = "PurchaseByCustomer",
  time_column_name = "purchase_time",
  entity_key_column_name = "customer_id",
  subsort_column_name = "subsort_id",
)

purchases_url = "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1SLdIw9uc0RGHY-eKzS30UBhN0NJtslkk"
r = requests.get(purchases_url, allow_redirects=True)
open('purchases.parquet', 'wb').write(r.content)
table.load('Purchase', 'purchases.parquet')
table.load('PurchaseByCustomer', 'purchases.parquet')

table.create_table(
  table_name = "FraudReport",
  time_column_name = "time",
  entity_key_column_name = "purchase_id",
  subsort_column_name = "subsort_id",
)

frauds_url = "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1WXRW1zt1EEPcbrw4nw9rCdhTqlatxTSR"
f = requests.get(frauds_url, allow_redirects=True)
open('frauds.parquet', 'wb').write(r.content)
table.load('FraudReporting', 'frauds.parquet')
----

== Feature Definitions

To train a model we must produce separate training and validation
datasets. These datasets will be created by partitioning the full set of
training examples into two time ranges, one spanning the years 2000-2015
and another spanning the years 2015-2020.

We'll execute the feature query twice, once to produce the training
dataset and another time to produce the validation dataset. The training
query will provide start and end times corresponding to the time
interval 2000-2015, while the validation query will times corresponding
to the time interval 2015-2020.

[NOTE]
.Usage
====
The fenlmagic extension is designed to make it easy to
interactively explore your dataset. When you're ready to train a
model we recommend using the Python client. The python client exposes
the full functionality of the Kaskada API and is better-suited to tasks
such as managing Views, Tables, and making multiple queries with
different query variables.
====

[source,Fenl]
----
%%fenl --var examples

let average_purchase_by_customer = PurchaseByCustomer.amount
  | mean()

let predictors = {
    entity: Purchase.id,
    purchase_total: Purchase.amount | last(),
    mean_purchase: lookup(Purchase.customer_id, average_purchase_by_customer),
}
let target = {
  target: count(FraudReport),
}

let shifted =  predictors 
  | shift_to(time_of($input) | add_time(days(30)))

in shifted | extend(lookup($input.entity, target))
----

We've provided the fenl-magic flag `--var examples` which causes the
query string to be assigned to a local variable named `examples`. We'll
use this variable to create a view we can re-use when we make the
training and validation queries.

[source,python]
----
from kaskada import view

view.create_view(
    view_name = "Examples",
    expression = examples.query,
)
----

== Training a Model Locally

Depending on the size of your training dataset and how you intend to
train a model, you may want to copy the training features locally or
transfer them to a remote data store. We'll show the simple case of
training locally.

Begin by limiting the examples to the training time range.

[source,Fenl]
----
%%fenl --var training

Examples 
  | when(time_of($input) > ("2020-01-01T00:00:00Z" as timestamp_ns))
    and time_of($input) <= ("2020-02-03T00:00:00Z" as timestamp_ns))
----

Next we limit the examples to different time bounds to produce a
validation dataset.

[source,Fenl]
----
%%fenl --var validation

Examples 
  | when(time_of($input) > ("2020-02-03T00:00:00Z" as timestamp_ns))
    and time_of($input) <= ("2020-04-12T00:00:00Z" as timestamp_ns))
----

We're finally ready to train a model. This shows a simple linear
regression model.

[source,python]
----
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn import preprocessing

X_train = training.dataframe.drop(['_time', '_subsort', '_key', '_key_hash', 'entity', 'target'], axis = 1)
y_train = training['target']
X_validation = validation.drop(['_time', '_subsort', '_key', '_key_hash', 'entity', 'target'], axis = 1)
y_validation = validation['target']

scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X_train)
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_validation_scaled = scaler.transform(X_validation)

model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

model.score(X_validation_scaled, y_validation)
