= Working with Records

https://docs.kaskada.com/docs/data-model#records[Records] allow one or
more values into a single record. Each value is part of a named field
within the record.

== Creating a Record

Records may be created using curly braces, such as
`{name: "john", age: 32}`. The corresponding type would be described as
`{name: string, age: number}`. 



[WARNING]
.Order of Record Fields
====
Fields in a record are
ordered, and the ordering matters, both for determining if two records
are the same type as well as for determining the order of columns in the
output.
====

== Extending a Record

A record may be extended with the fields of another record. When names
collide, the new fields override the older fields. This may be done as
`extend(new_record, original)` or `original | extend(new_record)`.

Example:
`{name: "john", age: 32} | extend({age: 33, lastname: "smith" })` would
produce the record `{name: "john", age: 33, lastname: "smith" }`.

== Selecting or Projecting Fields

Specific fields from a record may be selected using `select_fields`. The
result is a record containing only the specified fields.

Example:
`select_fields({name: "john", age: 33, lastname: "smith" }, "lastname", "name")`
produces the record `{name: "john", lastname: "smith"}`.

== Removing Fields

Specific fields from a record may be removed using `remove_fields`. The
result is a record without the named fields.

Example:
`remove_fields({name: "john", age: 33, lastname: "smith" }, "lastname", "name")`
produces the record `{age: 33}`.
